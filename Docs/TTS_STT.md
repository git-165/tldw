It's just the 3 buttons (speech-to-text, ssl, semantics) and then training. 

The default training settings on the gradio UI are fine but I save epoch 12-16-24 on SoVITS for testing as that's the sweet spot range.

Next thing that matters a lot is the ref audio you pick, and you can also drop your entire dataset into the "multiple references to average tone" box, which can improve the voice

Only thing I changed was remove the space at the beginning of each lines in your list file

(Look at batch size/ list file)

And make sure you get the latest version https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/releases
