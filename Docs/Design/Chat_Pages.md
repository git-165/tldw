### Chat Dictionaries
- **101**
  - In tldw, there is a functionality called 'Chat Dictionaries'.
  - These are essentially a list of words or phrases that are looked for and replaced with a matching word or phrase or sentence/paragraph/etc.
  - The idea is to allow for the LLM to gain context around certain words or phrases that may not be common knowledge.
  - An example might be replacing '101' with '101(is a term used to describe the basics of a subject)' (Although honestly I'd be surprised if 101 wasn't in the LLM's vocabulary.)
  - So with this, the LLM can be fed a sentence like "I need help with 101" and it can respond with "I can help you with the basics of a subject."
  - This is a very basic example, but the idea is to allow the LLM to understand and respond to a wider range of topics and questions.
- **Usage**
  - Chat dictionaries may be used from the config file or from the chat page itself.
