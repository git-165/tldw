### Character Chat Page





### Chat Dictionaries
- **101**
  - In tldw, there is a functionality called 'Chat Dictionaries'.
  - These are essentially a list of words or phrases that are looked for and replaced with a matching word or phrase or sentence/paragraph/etc.
  - The idea is to allow for the LLM to gain context around certain words or phrases that may not be common knowledge.
  - An example might be replacing '101' with '101(is a term used to describe the basics of a subject)' (Although honestly I'd be surprised if 101 wasn't in the LLM's vocabulary.)
  - So with this, the LLM can be fed a sentence like "I need help with 101" and it can respond with "I can help you with the basics of a subject."
  - This is a very basic example, but the idea is to allow the LLM to understand and respond to a wider range of topics and questions.
- **Usage**
  - Chat dictionaries may be used from the config file or from the chat page itself.
- **Implementation**

# Chat Dictionary User Manual Specification

## 1. Introduction
The **Chat Dictionary** dynamically modifies chat messages before sending them to an LLM. Use it for:
- Dynamic responses based on keywords/patterns
- Managing lore/world-building in role-playing
- Enforcing consistent terminology
- Adding context-aware behavior

---

## 2. Key Features
1. Text Replacement
2. Regex Support
3. Probability-Based Triggers (0-100%)
4. Group Conflict Resolution
5. Token Budget Management
6. Timed Effects (cooldowns/delays)
7. Replacement Limits

---

## 3. File Format
Save entries in `.md` files with this structure:

### 3.1 Basic Syntax
```
Single-line:
    key: value
```

```
Multi-line:
    key: |
      line1
      line2
---@@@---
```

### 3.2 Advanced Syntax
Regex pattern:
    /pattern/: replacement

Add properties:
    key: value | probability=50 group=global

---

## 4. Entry Properties
| Property         | Description                          | Default |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| key              | Word/phrase/regex to match           | Required|
| content          | Replacement text                     | Required|
| probability      | Trigger chance (0-100)               | 100     |
| group            | Category for conflict resolution     | None    |
| timed_effects    | cooldown/delay/sticky (seconds)      | None    |
| max_replacements | Maximum uses                         | 1       |

---

## 5. Usage Examples

### Simple Replacement
    greeting: Hello!

### Regex Replacement
    /\b\d{3}-\d{4}\b/: REDACTED-PHONE

### Multi-Line Entry
```
    weather: |
      Current: Sunny
      Temp: 75Â°F
---@@@---
```
### Timed Entry
    alert: System overload! | timed_effects={"cooldown":60}

---

## 6. Integration Steps
1. Upload `.md` files via UI
2. Configure settings:
   - Max Tokens (500-2000)
   - Strategy (sorted_evenly/character_first/global_first)
3. Replacements auto-apply to user input

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

**Problem**            | **Solution**
-----------------------|-----------------------------
No replacement         | Check key spelling/regex
Token limit exceeded   | Reduce content length
Unexpected behavior    | Check group conflicts
File not loading       | Validate markdown syntax

---
